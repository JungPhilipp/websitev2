Welcome to my personal website.
I am a Software Engineer at [SAP SE](http://www.sap.com/) in Walldorf, Germany, where I work on the HANA database kernel.
After I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science from [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en),
 I worked on structural mechanics simulations at [Volume Graphics](https://www.volumegraphics.com/).
You can find my contact info on the contact tab below. This site contains information about my career and various things I am interested in, including a small blog where I sometimes post about C++, CMake, Rust, and other technical topics.
